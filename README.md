Working vacation planner. An employee has an interface to plan a trip, sign up for shifts to pay for it, and arrange housing rental.

Transferable labor is pooled and workers choose from available tasks and locations. This system relies on several other pieces of software:

* [Housing](https://github.com/dhappy/housing) — Rental of short-term housing.
* [Costs](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/costs) — Computing prices for customers from inventory and labor.
* [Shifts](https://github.com/OneAcreCafe/volunteers) — Work to do while traveling to pay for expenses.
